# The Art of Code

Great talk at NDC { London } 2020 - watch [at youtube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6avJHaC3C2U)

Lots of funny demos. Some include:

* Sonic Pi - write music with programmer syntax
* Quines - programs that output their own source code
  * An impressive one is [Uroboros quine](https://github.com/mame/quine-relay) that goes through 128 programming languages to end back in the original source code.
  * Generally requires tricks, so one might learn a bit from reading and understanding them.
* Piet (programming language) - esoteric language which uses 16bit colour pictures to program.
* Rockstar (programming language) - another eso-lang with syntax that look like 1980's heavy metal songs.
