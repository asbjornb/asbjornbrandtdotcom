# 11ty-build

When building with eleventy usually just call ´npm start´. However to debug one can use ´set DEBUG=Eleventy* & npx @11ty/eleventy´ - see more on debugging at <https://www.11ty.dev/docs/debugging/>.

Eleventy uses .eleventyignore and .gitignore from the generators root (same folder as .eleventy.js).
