# Writing

* Put your most important idea first!
  * This change alone will improve your writing the most
* Eliminate commas
* Use active voice
  * Do it by eliminating passive voice
* Read your writing out loud!
* Apply clarity index (just an alternative to Flesch below):
  * Pick a passage/sample of 150-250 words
  * Count number of words
  * Count number of sentences
  * Count number of words with 3 sentences or more
  * Divide #words/#sentences - ~15 is a good target
  * Divide #LongWords/#Words as percent - ~15% is a good target
  * Add both for clarity score - ~20-40 is good. Most people will be over 40 if they don't edit to lower it.
* Edit, edit, edit, edit, edit
