# Programming languages

Currently I value static types in method definitions. Actually I would love a stronger type system, but the list of languages that I might like which have stronger type systems seems limited. Algebraic types are present in:

* F#
* Scala
* Rust (in some sense)

See more at [wikipedia - Programming languages with algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type#Programming_languages_with_algebraic_data_types)

Languages I currently use:

* C#
* Sql
* Python (a bit)

Am looking at practicing python a bit more, but in the future I might also want to experiment with:

* F#
* Scala
* R
* Golang
* Elixir
* Javascript
