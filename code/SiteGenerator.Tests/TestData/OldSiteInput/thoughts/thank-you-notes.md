# Thank you notes

Buy a card and matching envelope and follow this script:

* Dear name
* If long ago: I know this is long overdue.
* Thank you for \<some specific thing>.
* 2 simple sentences to add specificity and context
* If someone you don't see again/regularly: Best wishes. Else: Looking forward to continued working together.
