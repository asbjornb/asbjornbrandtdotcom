# 11ty

## package.json

This file holds metadata for the project.

The "scripts"-section sets npm commands. E.g.:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "eleventy --serve",
    "compile": "eleventy"}
```

lets you use `npm start` to serve eleventy or `npm compile` to build the static site content from templates.

Filtering with 11ty ignore seems difficult to do based on content. Perhaps an easier way is to create a small python/bat/.exe file that copies the thoughts repository to a content folder but excludes files. That process can then also do other preprocessing like generate front matter etc :)
