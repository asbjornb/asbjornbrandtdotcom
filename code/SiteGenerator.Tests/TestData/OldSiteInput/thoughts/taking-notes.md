# Taking notes

## Tools to consider (all these are probably worth trying)

* Foam
  * Markdown files only. Everything else are just extensions.
* Evernote
  * paid popular gui tool
* One note
  * paid popular gui tool
* Notion
  * paid popular gui tool
* Obsidian
  * paid open source tool - markdown files
* Trillium
  * floss (free open source). Db-format. Category-trees but cloned notes live across. No tags, but attributes fill a similar role.
* Joplin
  * floss. Has android support?

## Structure

* Concept of fluid frameworks:
  * Directory structures or category structures limit what you can input - it's top down.
  * Fluid frameworks are other ways to organize but external to the notes themselves
  * Examples are structure notes or moc's (maps of content) that can be created and deleted as needed without touching the original notes.
