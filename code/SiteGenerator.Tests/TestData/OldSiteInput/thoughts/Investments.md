* Currently (2021-01-11) Danske Invest has cheaper running costs (though about same Ã…OP) as Sparindex. In short:
  * Sparindex min risk has only developed world and 3-400 stocks at a time tracking MSCI World Min Volatility ~23 countries
  * Sparindex Globale Akt KL also has 3-400 stocks but tracks ACWI 49 countries
  * Danske invest has ~1600 stocks tracking only 23 developed countries.

Still supplementing Danske Invest with Emerging Markets might be cheaper and with less tracking error.
