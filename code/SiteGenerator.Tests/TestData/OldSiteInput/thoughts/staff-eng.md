# Staff eng

Some simple insights from the Staff eng podcast:

* Everything is your responsibility. If it needs doing then do it
* Meet with consumers, sit there while they try your new product. Take feedback and meet again 1 week later to show that their issues have been resolved.
* Do pair programming!
* Spend time finding out what the biggest problems are that you can fix - then fix them
* Communication is probably the most important staff-eng skill
* Use only soft power

Work staff engineers do:

* Solve business problems
* Mentor and sponsor people
* Fix issues/unblock and remove friction for other developers
* Set technical direction
