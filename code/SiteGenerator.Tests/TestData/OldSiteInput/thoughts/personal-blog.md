# Personal blog

## Blog vs. medium/linkedin articles

* Pros/cons for both
* Blog can't be deleted by third party
* Allows dofollow links for further projects after building authority
* Blog has a nice single place for personal knowledgebase
* Blog can be used to practice other programming projects too

On the other hand:

* Medium/linkedin might have better SEO/visibility off the bat
* Medium/linkedin has immediate reach to contacts and users
* No technical setup - just start posting
* Linkedin directly visible to recruiters as well
