# Boyds Law of Iteration

> Speed of iteration beats quality of iteration

In programming (and most other endeavors) getting near continuos feedback is the best way to move fast, learn fast and output. [This article](https://blog.codinghorror.com/boyds-law-of-iteration/) on codinghorror reiterates an analogy from air combat. In short:

* MiG-15 aircraft had better maneuverability than F-86 but still lost in fights.
* F-86 had hydraulic controls that reacted faster and gave faster cycles of Observing, Orienting, Planning, and Acting
* Faster cycles were far more important than the better observability from the MiG or the better acting possible.

## How

* Robust, realistic and fast test environments - can't move fast if I can't test fast
* Automated build and release
* Version control and easy rollback
