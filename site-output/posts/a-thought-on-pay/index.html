    <p>I had a thought today:
I hear much discussion on how much engineers get paid. Sometimes with a tone of “those greedy devs.”</p>
<p>But what does a low salary actually say about the company?</p>
<p>Maybe it is a signal that they don’t really know how to leverage engineers well which might be a frustrating experience too:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your time goes to endless backlog grooming, status meetings, or process theater.</li>
<li>You won’t get the tools you need. A $20 license becomes a fight - never mind proper observability or a conference ticket.</li>
<li>They can’t figure out what delivers value, so you spend three years polishing an intranet portal while the world moves on.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that mentor you hoped to learn from? If the company underpays, they’re probably already working at the competitor.</p>
<p>Sure, money isn’t everything. But following it can be a decent proxy for places where your work matters, where people are sharp, and where engineering is seen as leverage, not overhead.</p>
<p>Sometimes, low pay isn’t just about the salary.
It’s a symptom.</p>
<p>(Of course, this is just a thought, and a generalization. I don’t know if the same pattern applies outside of tech, but I wouldn’t be surprised.)</p>
