    <p>Recent discussions at work made me reflect over Jira and more generally team processes.
Potentially hot take 🌶️ I've used Jira for over eight years now. I have yet to see significant benefit using it for anything other than a backlog of things we really intend to do, can't do right now, and that are more than just ideas (ideas are cheap — we'll have better ones next month). That list is fairly short.</p>
<p>I'm sure it has great use cases like coordinating with external stakeholders or managing work in teams spread across different offices or even timezones.</p>
<p>But what really unlocked a new mental model for me and clarified my discomfort with Jira and similar tools was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/agileotter/">Tim Ottinger</a>'s (well, I heard it from him) framing of &quot;Solo Ticket Processing.&quot; Jira is often used to split work into small tasks, which can then be spread across a team. The idea is to parallelize and thus improve velocity, but software engineers don't really work like that. Un-teaming a group of developers and assigning them solo tickets for parallel execution isn’t a silver bullet for unlocking extra potential—more often, it has the opposite effect.</p>
<p>I could keep going on this, but I think you're better off checking out some of Tim's blog posts like this one: <a href="https://agileotter.blogspot.com/2015/04/individual-work-assignments-neither.html">Individual Work Assignments: Neither Agile Nor Team</a></p>
