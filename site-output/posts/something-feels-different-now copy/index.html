    <p>I’ve used ChatGPT and Claude since they came out, including a fair bit for coding. Helpful, sometimes surprisingly so. Useful, but not transformative.</p>
<p>This week I tried the new agentic tools: Claude Code (and to a lesser extent OpenAI’s Codex). It feels like a completely new gear.</p>
<p>Not a new UI. Not a marginal gain. More like instructing clones of yourself that can draft, refine, explain its reasoning, and work with you iteratively. It’s still just a tool, but suddenly a much more capable one.</p>
<p>I haven’t been one to jump on the LinkedIn CEO/Founder/AI Salesman hype, but some thoughts are forming:</p>
<ul>
<li>This increases output significantly. 2–10× for many tasks feels within reach. In 2 hours yesterday, I did what would have taken me 1–2 days last week.</li>
<li>Engineers are still responsible for every line. Maybe even more so, because it’s so tempting to just accept a good-looking draft.</li>
<li>It doesn’t replace skill. The quality of the output matched the quality of my instructions, corrections, and review.</li>
<li>It shifts the effort: less time typing, more time designing, testing, documenting.</li>
</ul>
<p>One interesting side effect is that it probably makes small internal tools worth building like:
– A tool to verify that critical data landed in the data platform for specific time slices
– A quick dashboard to debug a rare heisenbug
– A one-off HTTP proxy to rewrite legacy API responses
– A CLI to inspect Redis cache usage across workloads
– A GitHub Action tailored to one quirky project</p>
<p>You haven’t missed the train if you're not using these yet. Whether you adopt it now or in a month won’t decide who wins. But it does feel inevitable.</p>
<p>I’ll be arguing for using Claude Code at work. I think our backlog throughput will prove the business case on its own.</p>
<p>I don't care for hype, but it might be a real shift in how we work as engineers.</p>
