        <h1>Inspiration for this site</h1>
<p>I've long been fascinated with zettelkasten, personal wikis, gtd and similar but never committed. I initially experimented with <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam">Foam</a> to try it out and collected some simple notes, though I've since moved to a custom approach. Reading more blogposts this one really resonated with me: <a href="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/">Building a digital Garden</a> - give it a read and see if you agree.</p>
<h2>A digital garden</h2>
<p>Quoting <a href="https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners">Maggie Appleton</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A garden is something in between a personal blog and a wiki. It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – posts are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal &quot;blogs&quot; we're used to encountering on the web.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The technical stuff</h2>
<p>As many others in the note-taking/static-site/mind-garden space I didn't want to lock myself into some proprietary software. I've built a custom static site generator in C#, but all my notes and website content exists only as markdown files. This means I can take my content elsewhere without much ado if I want to change tools again.</p>
<h2>Longer term</h2>
<p>So far I still need to figure out some stuff. Building a note-graph visualization would be interesting to add to the site. Also I'd love to setup commenting for some parts of this site, but haven't yet settled on a great way to do just that. For now <a href="https://github.com/asbjornb/asbjornbrandtdotcom">my github</a> is the best interaction point. As is apparent, my design sense is also certainly unrefined (well just crap).</p>
