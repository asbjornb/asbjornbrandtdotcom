# LinkedIn vs internal comms

Had an interesting realization today: I feel safer sharing some thoughts about work on LinkedIn than in our internal company Teams channels.

For example, I might openly share thoughts on Jira or Scrum here but hesitate to do so internally. Anything contrary to majority opinion or company standards might be unwelcome - or that could just be in my head. It’s curious how my LinkedIn posts often spark real-life conversations at work (colleagues mention them in the coffee queue!).

It really shouldn’t be that way. Organizations benefit from challenging the status quo and hearing diverse opinions from people on the floor. Perhaps it’s about finding the right format for company commentary as an IC - almost like an editorial. Or maybe personal platforms like a blog or LinkedIn are simply better suited for that if you're not in management.

Does anyone else experience this? How can we create spaces - internal or external - that encourage open, constructive dialogue about how we work?
