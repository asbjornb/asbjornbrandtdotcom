# Hi, I'm Asbjørn

<p class="sideimg"><img src="assets/profile.png" alt="profile"></p>

A developer, data-enthusiast, nerd and a life long learner. I love learning new things and this site is another attempt at trying out new tech rather than just reading about it.

I previously blogged a bit on personal finance over at [firedk.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210327154824/https://firedk.com/blog/) (I've since lost the domain) but learned quickly that I prefer to just write when I have time and inspiration rather than try to publish on a schedule. This site will run with that observation so no regular blog posts with dates - rather this is a [digital garden](inspiration).

To get in touch just reach out at asbjoernbrandt@gmail.com or interact at the [github for this site](https://github.com/asbjornb/asbjornbrandtdotcom).
