# Now

## :house: Personal

* 4 small kids - both great joy and lots of funny moments, but fairly busy
* Going to South East Asia for 2 months in Feb-April with the family - looking forward to some sun and fun!

## :dollar: Work

* Working a senior role where I find less time for coding and more time setting direction and working with stakeholders - but luckily still get some head-down coding time
* Mostly working with .NET and Azure Sql Hyperscale, but also Python, ClickHouse and Data Lakes.

## :computer: Tech

* Experimenting with Claude Code and OpenAI Codex - it is great fun! Claude Code is the first tool that really has me pondering about the future of software development. Love one shotting small apps or using it to help me quickly fix bugs or add small features.

## :books: Reading

For tech books I finished Managing People, Peopleware, Multipliers and Team Topologies recently. I'm currently listening to The Unicorn Project.

I also read Dungeon Crawler Carl recently - best silly book I've read in a while! Also loved Will of the Many but not sure if I want to read The Strength of the Few or if I should wait for book 3. Reading Vildheks and before that Skammerens Datter with my kids.
