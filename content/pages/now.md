# Now

## :house: Personal

* 4 small kids - both great joy and lots of funny moments, but fairly busy

## :dollar: Work

* Working a senior role where I find less time for coding and more time setting direction and working with stakeholders - but luckily still get some head-down coding time
* Mostly working with .NET and Azure Sql Hyperscale, but also Python, ClickHouse.

## :computer: Tech

* Experimenting with Claude Code and OpenAI Codex - it is great fun! Claude Code is the first tool that really has me pondering about the future of software development.

## :books: Reading

For tech books I finished Software Engineering at Google, Accelerate, The Phoenix Project, Modern Software Engineering and Leading Effective Engineering Teams this year. Currently listening to The Software Engineer's Guidebook by Gergely Orosz.

I also read Digital Minimalism, the Brandon Sanderson Reckoners series and The Emperor of Portugallia. Most recent fiction was Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn series.
