Some quick tips for sql and SSMS that I really enjoyed when I found them.

* A keyboard shortcut can be made to change server connection. I usually use ctrl+alt+u
* Keyboard shortcuts can be made to run custom queries or procedures with selection in SSMS passed as input. COUNT(*), SELECT TOP 100 *, diagnostic sp's make for good options. See [[ssms-shortcuts]] for more.
